# React pie charts size

Measure the bundle size of the main React pie chart libraries. Written for [react-minimal-pie-chart](https://github.com/toomuchdesign/react-minimal-pie-chart) docs.

`react`, `react-dom` and `prop-types` are excluded from size count.

## Todo

- Strip `prop-types` notations from dependencies' bundles

```
npm run size
```
